        <h2>Bamboo Umbrellas</h2><br>
        <p>Have you ever heard about bamboo parasols in Thailand? This traditional craft is practiced in Bo Sang, a village on the outskirts of Chiang Mai.</p><br>
        <p>This village has been making traditional parasols for centuries and continues to be one of the most renowned centers for this unique art form.</p><br>
        <p>Each part of the bamboo parasol is meticulously hand-made. The Saa paper cover is the traditional way to finish these umbrellas but nowadays there are silk and cotton ones available too. Typically they’re finished with beautiful floral paintings.</p><br>
        <p>The craft of creating bamboo parasols is believed to have originated with the Buddhist monk Phra Inthaa, who traveled to Burma and received a paper parasol to shelter himself from the sun.</p><br>
